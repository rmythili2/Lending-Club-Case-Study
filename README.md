## Conclusions
- Customers are more likely to default whose debt to income ratio is more than 25 or the loan amount is more than 25000 irrespective of DTI value. Lending club should consider DTI metric to be less than 25 while issuing the loans
- Grades and Sub grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information from borrowers before issuing loans to B5, B3 and C1 sub grades. Also, A4, A5 and B3 sub grade loans have highest probably of being fully paid off.
- Lending Club should consider giving lesser loan amount for customers with bankruptcy public records of 2 or less
- Lending Club should control their number of loans issued to customers who are from CA, FL and NY states to make profits.
- Lending club should reduce giving loans for the purpose of debt consolidation,other and credit card with higher loan amounts.
- Lending club should reduce the high interest rates for 60 month loan term as they are more likely to default more.
